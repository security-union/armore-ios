Hi friends, we are just updating for a localization bug and updating the app store listing.

Our system does not require a password, instead, an email must be associated with the account, then on login, a one time pin is sent.

We created a gmail for you guys, feel free to change it or to use a different email account. 

** Gmail emails might take up to 5 minutes to be delivered.
