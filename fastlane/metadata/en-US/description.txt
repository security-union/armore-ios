Armore is a FREE location sharing app available for iOS and other mobile platforms. 

Armore uses your phone's internet connection & GPS tracking to provide your real-time location to your friends and family. We use the same technology as Whatsapp to secure end-to-end encrypted location data. Meaning only the people you invite to follow you can access your location data. 

We are aiming to build a safer world with Armore. We believe that technology should work for people instead of profiting off of people; therefore, we do not plan to sell any user data from Armore.
